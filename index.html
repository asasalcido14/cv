  <p>A recent Nutritional Science graduate from the University of Arizona with a Certification in Full-Stack Development. While earning my education at the university and community colleges, I continued to pursue my interests in nutrition,
    technology, and sports, by seeking employment and volunteer opportunities in those areas.

    I quickly accepted the fact that working while going to school was mandatory so I was lucky enough to utilize opportunities to work for companies such as ClearLink, In-N-Out Burger and Tommy Bahama where I developed all the skills that involve
    customer service and being confident in creating an effective sales pitch. I also learned a tremendous amount from the volunteer experiences in coaching youth football and teaching lessons to elementary students at the local Tucson Village Farm.
    My most memorable moments involved helping the kids by teaching them different animal and nutrition facts, while also making it a fun environment so time was never a thought. Volunteering at the Lowell-Stevens football facility gave me the
    opportunity to interact with Division 1 athletes, coaches, and staff. Witnessing the football operations take place behind the scenes is one of my most cherished experiences during my time at the University of Arizona.

    Most recently, I've completed a Full-Stack Development Certification course where I collaborated with other developers to create different databases, projects, and applications using the languages we learned. My plan is to utilize code and all my
    other skillsets to a position where I can increase the value of the people and products around me. While at the same time, giving me a chance to grow as an individual, thinker, and creator.</p>
